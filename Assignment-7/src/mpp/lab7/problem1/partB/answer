contains method uses equal method of object class,
there is a equal method in Employee class but its not override the object's class equal method.
to solve this issue we need to override like as bellow
	@Override
	public boolean equals(Object obj) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		if (obj==null) return false;
		if (!(obj instanceOf Employee)) return false;
		Employee e = (Employee)obj;
		return return e.name.equals(name) && e.salary == salary;
	}
